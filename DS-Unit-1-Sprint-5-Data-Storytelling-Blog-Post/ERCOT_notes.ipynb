        "\n",
        "* ERCOT doesn't cover all Texas, El Paso and the upper panhandle and part of East Texas are not covered\n",
        "* Utilities began linking together after WW1, they sprouted up sporadically after Edison turned on the first power plant\n",
        "* Texas Interconnect System came about during WW2 allowing them to link to dams along TX rivers and send extra electricity to factories aiding the war\n",
        "* The Texas Interconnected System wanted to keep fed. regulators at bay\n",
        "* By not crossing state lines TX utilities avoided being subject to federal law, as in the Federal Power Act by Franklin Roosevelt in 1935\n",
        "* Self-reliance was also made easier in Texas, especially in the early days, because the state has substantial coal, natural gas and oil resources of its own to fuel power plants\n",
        "* ERCOT formed in '70 after a major blackout in the Northeast in Nov. '65 (worst in history). It was tasked with grid reliability in acc. with national standards\n",
        "* ERCOT has more responsibilites since TX's electrical dereg. a decade ago\n",
        "* ERCOT not in jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n",
        "* TX has been linked to other grids in special cases: WW2 needs and 'The Midnight Connection' between TX and OK\n",
        "* The Midnight Connection almost cost TX its electrical independence\n",
        "* TX is not isolated from other grids, 3 ties to Mexico, 2 ties to the Eastern US grid but neither trigger fed reg\n",
        "* Cost of electrical energy comes from the producers bid into the market roughly based on the cost of generation\n",
        "* Wind generation cost is very low, mostly determined by availability of wind\n",
        "* Nuclear is low cost\n",
        "* Nat gas and coal based generation cost is based on resp. fuel prices\n",
        "* Long term forecast: weather and economic growth factors\n",
        "* Near term forecast: driven by weather mostly and day of week\n",
        "* TX has 'single state jurisdiction' which is good for expansion of infra.\n",

        "* Electrical power is foundational for TX economic growth\n",
        "* Texas Interconnect System was the group of regions in TX before ERCOT\n",
        "* Western Interconnect includes El Paso and far west TX\n",
        "* Under Gov. GW Bush legislature granted ERCOT much more power and freedom\n",
        "* ERCOT is US's first Independent System Operator (ISO)\n",
        "* TX electricity consumers tend to pay less than normal because of facilitated competition between power plants by ERCOT\n",
        "* Customers can change their service provider almost instantly with electronic electricity boxes\n",
        "* Competitive Renewable Energy Zone: carry renewable energy across power lines to load centers like Austin\n",
        "* In 2015 12% of all energy consumed was renewable\n",
        "* Other ISOs (non-TX) have to go through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to request rule changes, in TX stakeholders come to consensus\n",
        "* TX doesn't use regions or zones, they use a nodal system based on generation location\n",
