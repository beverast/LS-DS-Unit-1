# Ideas for data storytelling
1. The unique status and operation of Texas' electrical grid in comparison to the rest of the country.
2. Effects of the 'Trade War' on US international trade

## You

What do you care about?
A few things I care about: markets, fairness, and the environment.

What do you know about?
I have an operational understanding of trading markets (stocks and cryptocurrencies), distributed systems fundamentals, programming languages, and an assortment of facts and opinions about the environment.

What decisions do you face?
I have to decide on a project that incorporates, hopefully, at least two of my interests. It must also have usable datasets.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
I can apply this template to both of my project ideas I believe.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
There will certainly be misconceptions about the trade war and its effect on the US. Also, I think most people 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I really like the stylization of the FiveThirtyEight writeups, but emulating that might be outside of my skill level right now. I think their stories are very easy to understand and the interavctivity makes them much more enjoyable than looking at a matplotlib chart.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes, for the electrical grid data I could hypothesize that Texas probably has more regular power delivery, or that they are more unstable. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
For the electrical grid I could alternatively ask about regional prices at peak demand hours, and compare them against each other and note how much renewable energy these regions employ.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could take this idea, and trasnpose it to regional gasoline prices over time and see which regions have the best prices overall.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I've sourced datasets for both of my topics from data.gov and a sister website eia.gov
